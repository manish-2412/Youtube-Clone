YouTube Clone

Welcome to the YouTube Clone project! This web application replicates the basic functionality and layout of YouTube. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a solid foundation for understanding and implementing key web development concepts.

Features

The YouTube Clone includes a main page with a video player, video descriptions, and related videos. The header features navigation links to Home, Trending, Subscriptions, and Library pages, while a search bar allows users to search for content. Each video page displays video content, detailed descriptions, and related videos, making it a comprehensive simulation of a video-sharing platform.
